# Slash Trash

## Description:

**Just like how we shouldn't pollute our global scope when coding, we shouldn't pollute our globe in real-life.**

Slash Trash is a user's tool to a low-waste lifestyle by tracking their product changes in the household.
It includes a search bar to find alternatives for everyday household items.
The application provides a way for a user to take actionable steps to go green.

### Background Info:
Plastic is ubiquitous in our society. It has many applications across multiple industries. Because of its widespread use, and often one-time use, it contributes to landfills.

Why should we avoid plastic?
1. Plastic is not biodegradable (never decomposes). Instead, it breaks down into microplastics that float in our oceans and waterways.
2. Recycled plastic is inferior to virgin plastic (newly-manufactured plastic). There is a finite amount of times recycled plastic can be recycled.

## Technologies Used:

- MongoDB
- Express
- Node

## Getting Started:

## Next Steps: Planned Future Enhancements

- **Additional Items and Alternatives:**
  This application currently has 5 items and 13 alternatives. More data needs to be added.

- **Include a page for beginners and a page for tips:**
  Users who are novices to this lifestyle might feel overwhelmed with all the information.
  A resource that includes beginner swaps (e.g. using a reusable water bottle or grocery bag) and tips to guide experienced and/or novice users on their journey would be beneficial.

- **Incorporate a feedback link:**
  Allows the user to input their opinions about the application. This allows for the continual improvement of the application and a better user experience.

- **No results found for a search:**
  There are many products in a household and it is difficult to compile them all into the application. By adding a feature where I can see what items are not returning results, I can add that particular item and its alternatives into the data for future users who want to search for that same item.

- **Seed my data to the local database rather than the production database (MongoAtlas):**
