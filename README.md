STATE WHAT THE PROBLEM IS FIRST: Why should we avoid plastic?

- Plastic is not biodegradable (never decomposes): It breaks down into microplastics,
- Single-use items contribute to the landfill.
- Plastic is usually not recyclable. It is cheaper for manufacturers to make plastic from stratch.

## Getting Started:

## Next Steps: Planned Future Enhancements

-**Expand Items and Alternatives**
This application currently has 5 items and 12 alternatives. More data needs to be added.

- **Include a page for beginners:**
  Users who are novices to this idea might feel overwhelmed with all the information.
  A link that includes beginner swaps (e.g. using a reusable water bottle or grocery bag) would be beneficial.

- **Include a page for Tips:**
  An additional resource to guide novice and/or experienced users on their journey to low-waste living.
  Incorporating a page that provides tips and tricks would be great.

- **Incorporate a feedback link:**
  Allows the user to input their opinions about the application. This allows for the continual improvement of the application.

- **No results found for a search:**
  There are many products in a household and it is difficult to compile them all into the application. By adding a feature where I can see what items are not returning results, I can add that particular item into the data model for future users who want to search for that same item.
